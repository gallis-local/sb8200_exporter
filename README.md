# sb8200_exporter
A prometheus exporter for the Arris SB8200

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/gallis-local/sb8200_exporter/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gallis-local/sb8200_exporter/actions/workflows/main.yml)


Need to update to work with new Arris Login page, need to troubleshoot. Setup for automated build

**UNMAINTAINED**: I no longer have an SB8200 due to moving out of the service area where I could use one. Please follow a fork, or make your own!
